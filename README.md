# CS50project Finance Tracker

## Figuring out what project to do

After some reading we considered doing a finance tracker which could 
- add transactions and reliably save to a csv file
- prepare a monthly summary of transactions
- generate a graphical report

## Steps

### Creating classes
We utilized object oriented programming to set up two classes which we will use in the project

The first class we called Transaction with  attributes:
- amount
- category (type the transaction is attached to)
- date (on which the transaction was made)
- description (short of the transaction)

```python
class Transaction:
    def __init__(self, amount, category, date, description=""):
        self.amount = amount
        self.category = category
        self.date = date
        self.description = description
```

Them we set up the class FinanceTracker with several methods.  
- add transactions (which appends the file by adding transactions
```
def add_transaction(self, transaction):
        self.transactions.append(transaction)
```

- save_to_file (which instructs python to create the csv file if there was none present and saves the information
  added)
```
def save_to_file(self):
        with open(self.filename, "w", newline="") as file:
            writer = csv.writer(file)
            for t in self.transactions:
                writer.writerow([t.amount, t.category, t.date, t.description])
```

- load_from file (which opens the file and reads the data that is present in it). If no file has been created we use the exception FileNotFoundError with the statement that the "file was not found. Starting Fresh"
```
def load_from_file(self):
        try:
            with open(self.filename, "r") as file:
                reader = csv.reader(file)
                for row in reader:
                    amount, category, date, description = row
                    self.transactions.append(Transaction(float(amount), category, date, description))
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("No existing file found. Starting fresh.")
```

- monthly summary
```python
class FinanceTracker:
    def __init__(self, filename="finance_data.csv"):
        self.filename = filename
        self.transactions = []
```
